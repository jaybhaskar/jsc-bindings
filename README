This is just a proof of concept of how would look like a GObject API for JavaScriptCore.

* main.c is the client using the API.
* javascriptcore/javascript.h is the main header for the API
* javascriptcore/javascript.c is the implementation

With this POC API we are able to:
* easily bind native C callback to javascript functions
* call javascript functions from C code
